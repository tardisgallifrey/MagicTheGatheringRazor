<h1>A Magic the Gathering Card Database in C# and Razor Pages</h1>
<hr>
This is a project I've been wanting to work on. It uses several things that I like.

<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
    <li>.NET Core 5.0 Razor Pages app</li>
    <li>Magic the Gathering (c)Wizards of the Coast</li>
</ul>
<hr>
This is a companion repository to the other MTG app I have been working on, which is a console app.

I avoided doing this as a web app first as I didn't want the overhead, but I've figured out, I just need to "suck it up, butter cup", and deal with the overhead.

It is also a test project of mine to work on integrating C#, .NET Core 5.0, and EntityFrameworkCore into 
a project that is useful.

It makes use of EFCore's ability to create migrations and build SQL tables from Code Models.

It also makes heavy use of Enum classes for the various types and features of individual Magic the Gathering(c) playing cards.

Currently, it does very little.  I've just began the project.  If I can make it work in a console app, maybe I will eventually move it to a web app.

Use at your own caution.  No guarantees at all.
